Start by creating a copy of the example case, setting the aspect ratio in ./system/blockMeshDict. The variable "h" is equal to the aspect ratio.

Set desired mesh resolution by adjusting "NRinner," "NRouter," and "Nz." 

The files are set up so that all the dimensional quantites are automatically accounted for. 
The Reynolds number is equal to 1/nu, which can be adjusted from ./constant/transportProperties.

Before calculating energy budget quantities, it is necessary to adjust the list of coordinates by generating a new one from ListGenerator.m and pasting the list into ./system/sampleEB The quantities used in generating the list are explained in the report.

Once the case is set up, the Bash script MeshBuilder.sh can be ran with OpenFOAM in order to create the mesh, initialize velocity field, add random disturbances, optimize mesh storage, and check for errors.

The time-steps, data writing intervals, and other paramaters can be changed from ./system/controlDict.

The fvSchemes and fvSolution files contain solver parameters and tolerances.

The case can be ran with pimpleFoam after all steps are completed.

After simulation finishes, the instructions in PostProcessing.sh generate the necessary data to be sampled from OpenFOAM.

The MATLAB files in postProcessing "EBFieldOutpt.m" and "MeanAndVarFieldOutput.m" will output the complete field output as .mat files. They need to be ran from the same directory as the postProcessing file outputs.

The files are stored so that the first dimension r, the second z, and third is time.

Examples of how the data was used to generate some of the plots of the report are given in the file Plotting Utilities, including the analytical solution to the problem.
